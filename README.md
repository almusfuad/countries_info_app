# External API App

## Project Overview
A full-stack web application built with Django (backend) and React (frontend) to manage country information. Features include viewing, adding, updating, and deleting countries with pagination, search, and JWT-based authentication. The backend uses a PostgreSQL database and integrates with an external API for country data, while the frontend provides a responsive UI with Bulma CSS.
